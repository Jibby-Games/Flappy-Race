# About
Flappy Race is a free and open source 2D multiplayer game inspired by Flappy Bird and Mario Kart, created with **Godot 3**.

Works on desktop (Windows, Linux, Mac) and HTML5 platforms.

I started this project as a way to learn more about multiplayer game development in Godot and to learn about creating server backend code using Rust, Python and Docker.

## Features
- Items
- Bots
- Different game options
- Singleplayer and online multiplayer
- Official public servers (no port forwarding needed!)
- Self hosted servers (desktop only)
- Public server browser to see other games

All server infrastructure is also open source, see the [Flappy Backend](https://github.com/Jibby-Games/Flappy-Backend) repo for the code.
